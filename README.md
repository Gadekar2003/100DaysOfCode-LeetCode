# 100DaysOfCode-LeetCode DSA
"My 100 Days Challenge to solve LeetCode problems using JavaScript."<br><hr>
1) Problem 1: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.<br><hr>
2) Problem 2:Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).<br> <hr>
3) Problem 3:You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.<br> <hr>
4)Maximum sum of subarray numbers using kadanes's algorithm<br><hr>
5)Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.<br><hr>
6)Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums. Leetcode-26<br><hr>
8)Largest Element in the array geeks for geeks arr=1 8 7 56 90 largest is:-90<br><hr>
9)reverse a string leetcode-344 Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
