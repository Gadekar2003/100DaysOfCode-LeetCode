# 100DaysOfCode-LeetCode
"My 100 Days Challenge to solve LeetCode problems using JavaScript."
Problem 1: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.<br>
Problem 2:Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
