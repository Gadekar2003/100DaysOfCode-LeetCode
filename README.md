"My 100 Days Challenge to solve LeetCode problems using JavaScript."<br><hr>
### 1).Problem 1: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.<br><hr>
### 2) Problem 2:Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).<br> <hr>
### 3) Problem 3:You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.<br> <hr>
### 4)Maximum sum of subarray numbers using kadanes's algorithm<br><hr>
### 5)Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.<br><hr>
### 6)Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums. Leetcode-26<br><hr>
### 8)Largest Element in the array geeks for geeks arr=1 8 7 56 90 largest is:-90<br><hr>
### 9)reverse a string leetcode-344 Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.<br><hr>
### 10)You are given a string S that contains 3 characters: 'a', 'b', and '?'. Your task is to convert it to a string which contains only 2 characters: 'a', 'b'. The converted string must follow following conditions:
1. It should not contains two letters 'a' in a row.
2. if there are many strings possible, the answer should be one which is the first in alphabetical order
(Read sample test case for better understanding) <br><hr>
### 11)You are provided a string S. Your task is to print a string which also contains the number of times that character is repeated. (Read explanation of test case for better understanding) like input="aabbcc" output="a2b2c2".
### 11)Count Chars
Description
You are provided a string S. Your task is to print a string which also contains the number of times that character is repeated. (Read explanation of test case for better understanding) like:- aabb output is:-a2b2 <br><hr>
### 12)You are given price P[i] and Quantity Q[i] of N products that are added to a cart.
You need to find the total cost of the cart. input:-3
1 2 3
3 2 1
4
1 2 3 4
1 2 2 2
o/p:-10

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.<br><hr>
### 15) Leetcode:-69 Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.<br><hr>
### 16)58. Length of Last Word 
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.<br><hr>
